# @narumitw/sumire-url-tool

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b5f569: Add bounded Telegram document conversion and native Pi reply-tree routing. Package the safe `load_public_url` agent tool as `@narumitw/sumire-url-tool`; URL loading is agent-driven, without Telegram prefetch routing or pending URL state. Preserve finishing response checkpoints before branch navigation, reject stale submissions after reset, wait for pending reply-index writes before lookup, and hold document admission capacity from before download until child processes close, with atomic permit handoff to queued work. Make `/cancel` invalidate pending document input and suppress late results without resetting Pi history. Route `/ask` replies through the same bounded media-input pipeline so the agent receives replied document content.
